# Email Notification System

This system uses **Resend** to send automated email notifications for the Course Mapping application flow.

### 2. **Nomination Approved**
When admin approves a nomination:
- ‚úÖ **Student receives:** Congratulations email with next steps

---

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` file already contains:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_jZbc9WMP_BUZy1UrEKUDShkB94BTPv7vE
ADMIN_EMAIL=international@ajman.ac.ae
```

### Step 2: Verify Domain with Resend (Important!)

Currently, emails are sent from `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's test domain). **For production, you MUST verify your own domain.**

#### To add your domain:

1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `ajman.ac.ae` or `oiaa.ajman.ac.ae`)
4. Add the DNS records to your domain provider:
   - **SPF Record** (TXT)
   - **DKIM Record** (TXT)
   - **DMARC Record** (TXT)
5. Wait for verification (usually 5-30 minutes)

#### Update the FROM email:

Once verified, update `src/lib/resendClient.ts`:

```typescript
const FROM_EMAIL = "OIAA <noreply@ajman.ac.ae>"; // Change this to your verified domain
```

**Examples:**
- `"OIAA <noreply@ajman.ac.ae>"`
- `"International Office <international@ajman.ac.ae>"`
- `"Ajman University <exchange@ajman.ac.ae>"`

  // Modify HTML here
  return `...`;
}
```

### Modify PDF Layout

**Key sections:**

- Personal statement
- Destination details
- Course mapping table with status colors

## üì® Testing Emails

### Test in Development

1. Submit a test application
2. Check console logs for email status
3. Check your email inbox (student email from form)
4. Check admin inbox (`international@ajman.ac.ae`)

### Test Domain Setup

If emails aren't arriving:

1. **Check Resend logs:** [resend.com/emails](https://resend.com/emails)
2. **Check spam folder**
3. **Verify DNS records are correct**
4. **Ensure domain is verified** (green checkmark in Resend dashboard)

### Using Test Mode

Resend's test domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`) will only deliver to:
- Your verified email addresses in Resend
- Email addresses you've added as "Verified Emails" in Resend

**For full testing**, add test recipient emails in Resend Dashboard under "Verified Emails" or use your own domain.

## üîê Security Notes

- ‚úÖ API key is stored in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- ‚úÖ `.env*` is in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ All emails include PDF attachments generated server-side
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit your Resend API key to version control**

## üìä API Integration Points

**File:** `src/app/api/applications/route.ts`

After saving application:
```typescript
const { sendApplicationSubmissionEmails } = await import("@/lib/resendClient");
await sendApplicationSubmissionEmails(record);
```

### Nomination Approval
**File:** `src/app/api/admin/applications/[id]/route.ts`

When status changes to `nominated` or `approved`:
```typescript
const { sendNominationApprovedEmail } = await import("@/lib/resendClient");
await sendNominationApprovedEmail(application);
```
