## 🎨 Design Consistency

The admin panel maintains the same design language as the student portal:

- Subtle shadows and hover effects
- Color-coded status indicators
- Responsive grid layouts

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Session Management**
   - 24-hour session expiry
   - Secure token generation
   - HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks

2. **API Protection**
   - All admin routes require authentication
   - Session verification on every request
   - Unauthorized access returns 401

3. **Input Validation**
   - Zod schemas for all payloads
   - Type-safe API responses
   - Error handling throughout

## 📊 Data Structure

Applications are stored with comprehensive tracking:
```typescript
{
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  status: ApplicationStatus;      // Workflow state
  studentName: string;
  studentId: string;
  studentEmail: string;
  studentNationality: string;
  studentCollege: string;
  studentMajor: string;
  studentCGPA: string;
  personalStatement?: string;
  country: string;
  university: string;
  courses: CourseEvaluation[];
  allApproved: boolean;
  submittedAt: string;           // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string;             // ISO timestamp
  nextStepAction?: string;       // Future feature
  studentNotes?: string;         // Future feature
  adminNotes?: string;           // Future feature
}
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the admin panel:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/adminlogin`
   - Email: `international@ajman.ac.ae`
   - Password: `OI@a25`

3. Manage applications:
   - View metrics at the top
   - Use filters to focus on priority items
   - Search for specific applications
   - Update statuses with action buttons
   - Delete applications if needed

## 🎯 Priority Workflow

**Recommended Daily Routine:**
1. Check "Awaiting Nomination" filter first (high priority)
2. Process nominations quickly
